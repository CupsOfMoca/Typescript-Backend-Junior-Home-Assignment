### Solution for the assigmnet: Typescript Backend (junior) - Home Assignment
#### Made by Bence Török

I used MongoDB for the database.

I provided a postman collection for testing the endpoints. (id's will most likely need to be adjusted)

I did not have enough time to write unit tests, but from manual testing via postman, the endpoints seemed to work.

I also didn't have enough time to full set Swagger up in the project, but I have left the changes on branch #4.
